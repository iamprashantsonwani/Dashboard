        <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong><br>
        Results-oriented Java Developer with 5 years of experience crafting high-performance, scalable applications. Proficient in designing and implementing robust microservices architectures and DevOps practices. Possessing strong problem-solving and collaboration skills, I excel in delivering innovative solutions within fast-paced environments.</p>

        <p><strong>WORK EXPERIENCE:</strong><br>
        <strong>Senior Software Engineer | Energy financial services, General Electric, Tata Consultancy Services | India (2018 - 2021)</strong><br>
        ▪ Worked as a Senior Software Developer in the GE Capital environment, developing and implementing critical financial applications and leveraged CI/CD pipelines to accelerate delivery of robust, scalable solutions supporting complex financial transactions from deal structuring to portfolio management.<br>
        ▪ Managed the development and maintenance of the Deal-Pro system, a crucial application for overseeing customer deals throughout pre-deal and post-deal stages. Designed and implemented a multi-layer architecture for complex deal structuring and approvals, and developed a messaging service with integrated email notifications and dynamic action buttons for efficient deal approvals and rejections.<br>
        ▪ Played a key role in migrating the Money application from a legacy Java and jQuery-based setup to a modern architecture using Spring Boot and Angular. This involved a frontend redesign that enhanced user satisfaction by 40% and a backend refactor that improved system performance by 30% and reduced maintenance costs by 50%.<br>
        ▪ Developed and deployed a high-performance REST API for the Deal-Pro system using Spring Boot, handling over 100,000 deal-related requests per day, including deal approvals, status updates, and document submissions. Implemented a multi-tier approval workflow using Drools to manage different user levels (A1, A2, A3) for approval and rejection processes.<br>
        ▪ Enhanced the security framework across the application by implementing robust measures against common vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. By utilizing encoders and adhering to security best practices, I achieved a 75% reduction in reported security incidents. Additionally, I applied comprehensive input validation, output encoding, and security headers to safeguard data integrity and user privacy, ensuring compliance with OWASP standards.<br>
        ▪ Enhanced system efficiency by automating tasks with Office JS, achieved 95% code coverage through comprehensive unit and integration testing, and reduced deployment time by 70% using Jenkins and Appworx. Optimized database queries with MyBatis and Oracle, significantly improving execution times and overall system performance.</p>

        <p><strong>Software Engineer | Information lifecycle management, General Electric, Tata Consultancy Services | India (2016 - 2018)</strong><br>
        ▪ Actively engaged throughout the entire lifecycle of ILM Data Archival Services projects, including the installation and administration of ILM data archive products like Data Archive on Linux systems. Led troubleshooting efforts to resolve technical issues, ensuring smooth operation and system reliability.<br>
        ▪ Designed and implemented rules for data archival and masking, automating the process of copying data structures/objects from source to target databases and flat files using Oracle Swings and AWT. This automation streamlined data handling, reduced manual effort, and improved data accuracy.<br>
        ▪ Optimized database performance by developing and tuning stored procedures, indexes, and SQL queries. Implemented Java-based solutions for bug fixes and system enhancements. Ensured data integrity through robust validation and connectivity management.<br>
        ▪ Drove stakeholder engagement, delivered expert training on data archival focusing on archival access definitions, masking techniques, and efficient use of developed systems and built comprehensive documentation on streamlining troubleshooting to ensure seamless operations.</p>
